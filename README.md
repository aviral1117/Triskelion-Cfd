# Triskelion-Cfd
# Idea for codefundo++:


- We plan to implement a multi-disciplinary approach encompassing the domains of Machine Learning, Behavioral Biology & Meteorology to address the given problem: To save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.
 
- Our idea makes is to develop a Deep Learning based model using Artificial Neural Networks taking into account some of the most important factors that influence the occurrence of a natural calamity/ disaster. The main components that the model shall incorporate are:
  -  Weather conditions of the region.
  -  Historical data (past natural calamities & climatic changes).
  -  Tracking animalsâ€™ behaviour in the region.


- After successful development and deployment of the complete model on Azure, users can access this model directly through our GitHub repository and start making full use of it through step-by-step instructions that shall be mentioned along with the model.
 
- We plan to use datasets available on the following websites:
          https://www.movebank.org/
          https://darksky.net/dev
 
- Technology used:
  - Artificial Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
 
- How this model is unique?
Not being a trivial Machine Learning model, our model incorporates the behavioral analysis of animals before any calamity which can act as a huge boon for the accuracy of this predictive model. Not only can this technique be deployed to make better predictions but also give the authorities sufficient time to minimize the losses caused by these calamities. The side benefit of our work is that it may help the researchers round the globe to integrate animal behavior to their work in an improved fashion.

To know how animal behavior helps to predict natural calamities, please refer to the following articles/ study:
