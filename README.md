Codefundo++ 2018 round 2 

// Idea for the second round of codefundo++

The following file lists down the key aspects of our idea.
Problem addressed : To save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters.

Technology Used : Machine Learning / ANN

Natural disasters are one of few reasons that leads to mass destruction of human life and other assets and therefore the better the prediction for a calamity , the easier it becomes to relocate people to safe areas and thereby reduce the loss of life. 

One of the key aspects of our idea is the fact that many animals are able to predict an approaching natural disasters beforehand that is they have developed their senses to a level that they can sense a natural disaster like earthquakes , hurricanes , floods etc. and reach safer places within time. A number of studies on various animals have been conducted to assert this theory.
The following reports are some of the examples of the same :

Approach :
  We wish to develop a machine learning model that will take in the data collected from a group of animals in a region that have been tagged before-hand and use it to train itself based on the behaviour of animals in different situations. 
  
  Apart from the data collected from animals , the following factors will also be included in the model to improve the accuracy :
    a. Weather Conditions of the region.
    b.
